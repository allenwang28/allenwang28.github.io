Hey all

A lot has changed since the last time I posted. I still have not heard back from Dell yet for the position, but on the bright side, I did get an offer from National Instruments!
If everything goes according to plan, I will be a Software Engineering intern at NI based in Austin, and I will be working on the software for multifunction devices.
I'm so thankful for this opportunity and I am looking forward to learning a lot over the summer!

In other news, NCAA basketball is crazy. It's so unpredictable and teams play with so much heart but... 
I find it really boring. I understand the talent level isn't as high as it is in the NBA, but it's just not that fun to watch a lot of outside passes to a contested 3...
I know that it sort of is like stereotyping, but every time I have watched a college game, that's all it's been. It seems more like "team basketball" but it's just not very exciting for me.
Also, all the Texas teams are out in the first round, so maybe that's why it's not so exciting for me...

Anyways, I've been making some good progress on the roommate app. I've added in password resets and account activation via email, and programming is just fun again.
I feel like I'm cheating a little as I've been using the Rails tutorial to model everything, but I am learning a lot from it and it's only a matter of time until the base features are complete and I can just add whatever I want.
I really hope to get a prototype out and running by the summertime, that way I have time to add more stuff to it over the summer. 

As you can tell by the title, Spring Break is almost over (sad), which means it's back to the daily grind soon. I've had a good time relaxing a lot, but it just feels like I didn't do anything... at all.
I mean, that's completely fine, but I hope it doesn't come back to haunt me as I go back to school. Anyways, here's to finishing out the semester strong! I hope.
