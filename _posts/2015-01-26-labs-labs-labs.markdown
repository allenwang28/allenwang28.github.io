Year 2. Semester 2.

 Things only get harder from here. As an Electrical Engineering student,
"harder" isn't something that I really look forward to. Maybe "more challenging" is more of a glass half full approach,
but even with this mindset, the thought of my workload expanding like e<sup>x</sup> lingers in the back of my mind.


As you can tell by the title of this post, I know that labs are and will be parts of my classes for the rest of my college career. That's totally fine.
I mean, you only learn by doing, right? I only wish that I had a better experience regarding labs, and as someone who has potential aspirations in research, 
that is kind of scary that I still have lab-phobia. I really hope that in the future when I re-read my posts, I will be able to look back and say that now that I have completed it, it wasn't so bad - that I learned a lot and came out a better, stronger person! 


But that's in the future. Until then, though, I'll be here. Building circuits that I only hope will work.

Cheers!
