The Roommate App is an idea that I had when encountering problems with organization and management of the needs of many different people in one living situation. 
For instance, a problem we faced was remembering what we all owed each other (because generally one person would pay for a bill, buy a necessity, etc.), so we used
a white board to keep track of this. Although it isn't a tedious task to simply write numbers down and perform simple math, I thought, "Hey, why not just make an app for all of this? 
It's great experience to apply my new knowledge of Rails" and boom, the concept was born. 


I already assumed that there would be apps like this in existence, but I can't simply not create because something exists. If I thought like that, and if everyone else in the world
thought like that, then no one would even exist! (I hope you get that joke and I hope that was a good joke. (Sorry I'm tired after working on the app for the last 3 hours))


Anyways, so far I have been following the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> in order to make sure that my functionality works and everything correctly 
and because I have little to no experience with front end, so I'm stealing theirs for now until I get better at it.


I feel like this app could have some potential to actually be used by other people than just the inhabitants at my apartment, but if it doesn't then that's still okay 
because of the invaluable experience I would get from developing it. Either way, I hope to demo this project (in the form of a video) by the end of the semester.
I decided on Electrical Engineering as my major because I wanted to help people by making their lives easier by automating processes that are otherwise tedious. I hope that this will 
be a step in the right direction.
