# It's 80 degrees outside

It's January 27, 2015. And it's also **80 degrees outside**.

I just came back from my lab for Digital Logic Design, and to be honest, the post from last night was my response to the lab. Basically I had secretly panicked a bit because of some constraints and a complicated circuit, but it turns out that all of that was unnecessary because I didn't read the instructions correctly. Go figure.

Today I learned that "No greater than 11" *includes* the number 11. Had I thought about that yesterday, I would've maybe saved about 3 hours of heartbreak. I also learned that checking the temperature is probably a good thing. I mean look at this:

Oh well. I think that, if anything, this just goes to show that I should prepare more for things. 

In other news, there's this sculpture that was put up near the Engineering buildings during Winter Break, and it's rather infamous on social media. A lot of people pass by and pull out their phones to take a picture of it... but maybe not for the right reasons. Reactions range from "What is this?" to "This is hideous" to "I make art like this every morning, UT should pay me." Maybe I'll take a picture and put it up here too. My reaction though? It was a great source of shade on a pretty hot day.
