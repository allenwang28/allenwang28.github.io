It's been awhile since I last posted.

I've been very busy the last few weeks, and I haven't really been able to work on things that I really wanted to work on, like the Roommate App and other programming ventures.

Anyways, as you can tell by the title, I had an interview with Dell... yesterday. It was an interesting experience without technical questions, but I feel like it went well and I feel very excited for my chances.
I was asked about things that were on my resume, and I talked about my ideas for the Roommate App specifically. I talked about my experiences with Test-Driven Development and also talked a lot about my past experiences developing and testing software. 
I was then asked about my experience working with a team.. and that was pretty much the entirety of the interview. Overall it went well I would say, but now I'm just waiting for an offer.
