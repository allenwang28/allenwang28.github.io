## <a href="https://github.com/allenwang28/nbastats">nbastats</a>
In this project, I used Python combined with BeautifulSoup in order to create a web scraper to grab data from <a href="http://basketball-reference.com">Basketball-Reference</a>
in order to project NBA standings and misc. statistics without having to go through <a href="http://nba.com">nba.com</a>.

## <a href="https://github.com/allenwang28/the_roommate_app">The Roommate App!</a>
[WIP] This project was meant to fill a problem to track how much money everyone in my apartment owes each other. That functionality isn't exactly added yet, but I hope to add more features that solve problems that roommates usually have.
